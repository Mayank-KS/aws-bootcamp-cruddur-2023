On further trial and error I found the fault to be already existing containers pointing to the port

And it was solved by running the ```docker kill container``` command

## Added PostgreSQL and DynamoDB to Gitpod

Copied the code as instrusted and was able to successfully run Postgres and DynamoDB

```
psql -Upostgres --host localhost
